# Chrome Experience Requiem

Chrome experience requiem is a browser-based Forkbomb/Wabbit designed to be a JoJos reference.

Edit: Chill bros, don't get me written up over this lel.

## Notes

Can easily be blocked by almost any Browser in 1 of 2 ways:

- Some Browsers, such as *Google Chrome*, block audio from playing on websites based on the users "Media Engagement Index threshold" on a given website (See [here](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes) for more info). Because of this, the GioGio theme and "Kono Giorno Giovanna yume ga aru" will not play, unless the webpage is listed as "Allowed" under `Privacy & Security > Site Settings > Sound` in Chrome Settings.
- Most modern Browsers have Pop-Up blocking enabled by default. **If they have this feature and it is on, then Chrome Experience Requiem will not work.**

## Demos

Note that any demos shown have Popups and Audio autoplay enabled to show what Chrome Experience Requiem *supposed* to do.
